<p style="text-align: justify">
I am currently a master's student in the Department of Intelligent Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Science and Technology. The department originated from the Image Processing Research Group established in 1982. My major is Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems which is the national key discipline. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Automation from the School of Automation at Nanjing University of Science and Technology, and I participated in the Outstanding Engineer Education and Training Program. In 2021, I was recommended exemption for graduate student, and I chose to continue my studies at the original school.

Due to the characteristics of my major, I participated in many research projects and competitions during my study in the school, these experiences significantly enhanced my practical skills, problem-solving abilities and research innovation capabilities. My research interests lie in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and Unmanned Systems. I am interested and passionate in handling challenges of Artificial Intelligence in real-world applications. Currently, I am focusing and working hard on researching feasible reinforcement learning methods to address the control and decision-making issues of tilt-rotor VTOL aircraft, which is an important aircraft for  low-altitude economy.

My hometown is in the beautiful Quanzhou, Fujian. Since graduating from high school, it has been nearly seven years since I came to Nanjing for my study. In the future, I hope I can keep learning and making new progress, and I prefer to go to somewhere closer to my home if possible.
